# Employee Attendance & Work Preference Dashboard

This project delivers a Power BI dashboard that analyzes employee attendance patterns over the last 3 months to help HR teams make data-driven decisions on workplace preferences, engagement activities, and proactive health measures.

## üéØ Project Overview

A software company's HR department provided attendance data in Excel format, spread across multiple sheets with varying column headers. The goal was to build a comprehensive dashboard to answer questions such as:

- What is each employee's working preference (Work From Home, Office, Hybrid)?
- Are employees frequently working from home on Mondays or Fridays, potentially indicating extended weekends?
- Which days have the highest on-site presence to plan team-building activities or lunches?
- What are the trends in sick leave, so HR can proactively plan precautionary measures?

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation

**Power Query** was used to:

- Consolidate multiple Excel sheets with inconsistent headers.
- Transform and clean the data into a single, standardized table.
- Create calculated columns for attendance status (e.g., Present, WFH, Sick Leave).

## üìä Metrics & Measures

Key metrics were created using **DAX**, including:

- **% Work From Home**  
  The percentage of days employees worked remotely.
- **% Sick Leave**  
  The percentage of days employees were on sick leave.
- **Presence % by Date and Day of Week**  
  To analyze trends and spot patterns in office attendance.
- **WFH % by Date and Day of Week**  
  To identify employees frequently working from home on specific weekdays.
- **SL % by Date**  
  To visualize sick leave trends over time.

## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides:

- **Overall attendance KPIs** (Presence %, WFH %, Sick Leave %).
- **Daily trends** with line charts for each attendance type.
- **Day-of-week analysis** showing which weekdays have higher WFH or Sick Leave percentages.
- **Employee-level breakdowns** to identify individual work patterns.
